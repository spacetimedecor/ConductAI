<p>The <code>manimlib/__main__.py</code> file serves as the entry point for the Manim animation library. It is responsible for parsing command-line arguments, configuring the environment, and executing the main workflow to render scenes based on user input. This file orchestrates the process of running animations, managing scene execution, and handling user options to generate the desired visualizations.</p>
