<p>This code creates a simple animation using Manim. It displays a square and then applies a 'wiggle' animation to it, which involves both scaling and rotating the square around its center.</p>
<pre><code>from manim import *

class SquareWiggle(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        # Create a square Mobject
        square = Square()
        square.set_fill(BLUE, opacity=0.8) # Set fill color and opacity
        square.set_stroke(WHITE, width=4) # Set stroke color and width

        # Add the square to the scene
        self.play(Create(square))

        # Apply the WiggleOutThenIn animation to the square
        # This animation scales and rotates the square multiple times
        # scale_value: The maximum scale factor during the wiggle
        # rotation_angle: The maximum rotation angle during the wiggle
        # n_wiggles: The number of wiggles (cycles of scaling and rotation)
        # run_time: The duration of the animation in seconds
        self.play(WiggleOutThenIn(
            square,
            scale_value=1.2,
            rotation_angle=PI / 12, # Rotate by 15 degrees (PI/12 radians)
            n_wiggles=4,
            run_time=3
        ))

        # Keep the square on screen for a moment before ending
        self.wait(1)
