<p>The <code>manimlib/animation/indication.py</code> file defines a collection of animation classes used to create visual indication effects in the Manim library. These animations are primarily used to draw attention to specific objects or regions within a scene, often through highlighting, flashing, or surrounding shapes. The classes facilitate various types of emphasis, such as indicating focus, flashing objects, or highlighting passing animations.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>FocusOn</strong>: Highlights a specific object by focusing on it, typically by emphasizing or enlarging it.</li>
  <li><strong>Indicate</strong>: Creates an indication effect on a mobject, often by flashing or emphasizing it with a scale and color change.</li>
  <li><strong>Flash</strong>: Produces a quick flashing effect on a mobject to draw attention.</li>
  <li><strong>CircleIndicate</strong>: Highlights a mobject by drawing a circle around it, often with animation effects.</li>
  <li><strong>ShowPassingFlash</strong>: Displays a passing flash effect across a mobject, simulating movement or emphasis.</li>
  <li><strong>VShowPassingFlash</strong>: A vertical variant of the passing flash effect.</li>
  <li><strong>FlashAround</strong>: Creates a flashing outline around a mobject, emphasizing its boundary.</li>
  <li><strong>FlashUnder</strong>: Adds a flashing effect beneath a mobject, often used for highlighting or underlining.</li>
  <li><strong>ShowCreationThenDestruction</strong>: Animates the creation of a mobject followed by its destruction.</li>
  <li><strong>ShowCreationThenFadeOut</strong>: Similar to the above but fades out the mobject instead of destroying it.</li>
  <li><strong>AnimationOnSurroundingRectangle</strong>: Animates a rectangle surrounding a mobject, often used for highlighting or framing.</li>
  <li><strong>ShowPassingFlashAround</strong>: Combines passing flash effects with surrounding animations to emphasize objects.</li>
  <li><strong>ShowCreationThenDestructionAround</strong>: Creates and then destroys a surrounding shape around a mobject.</li>
  <li><strong>ShowCreationThenFadeAround</strong>: Creates and then fades out a surrounding shape around a mobject.</li>
  <li><strong>ApplyWave</strong>: Applies a wave distortion effect to a mobject for visual emphasis.</li>
  <li><strong>WiggleOutThenIn</strong>: Animates a wiggle effect outward and then back inward on a mobject.</li>
  <li><strong>TurnInsideOut</strong>: Transforms a mobject by turning it inside out, creating a visual flip effect.</li>
  <li><strong>FlashyFadeIn</strong>: Implements a flashy fade-in animation for objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the file includes initializers for some classes, such as <code>Indicate</code> and <code>ShowCreationThenDestruction</code>, which set up parameters like scale factors, colors, and timing for the animations.</p>
