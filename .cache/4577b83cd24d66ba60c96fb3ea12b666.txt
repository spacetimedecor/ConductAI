<p>The file <code>manimlib/mobject/svg/tex_mobject.py</code> defines classes related to rendering LaTeX text as SVG objects within animations. It provides mechanisms to create, manipulate, and display LaTeX-based mathematical and textual content in a scalable vector graphics format, facilitating high-quality visualizations in animations.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Tex</strong>: This class serves as a base for creating LaTeX-rendered SVG text objects, handling the conversion of LaTeX code into SVG paths and managing their display properties.</li>
  <li><strong>TexText</strong>: This class extends <code>Tex</code> to specifically handle plain text strings, allowing for the creation of SVG text objects from simple text inputs with LaTeX styling.</li>
</ul>
