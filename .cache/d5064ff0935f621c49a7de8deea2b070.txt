<p>The <code>manimlib/animation/numbers.py</code> file is responsible for defining animations related to numerical displays within the Manim library. It includes classes that animate changes in decimal numbers, such as transitioning from one value to another or counting in from a specific starting point. These animations are useful for creating dynamic visualizations of numerical data, calculations, or progress indicators in mathematical presentations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>ChangingDecimal</strong>: (Assumed from context) Likely a class that handles animations involving changing the displayed value of a decimal number object over time.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>ChangeDecimalToValue</strong>: (Assumed from context) Presumably a class that animates a decimal number object to change its value to a specified target value.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>CountInFrom</strong>: A class that animates a decimal number object to count in from a specified starting value to its current value, often used for animated counting effects.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>CountInFrom.__init__</strong>: The constructor method for the <code>CountInFrom</code> class, initializing the animation with a target decimal object and a source number to count in from, setting up the interpolation over time.
  </li>
</ul>
