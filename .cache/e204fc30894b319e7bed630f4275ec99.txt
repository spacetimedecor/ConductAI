<p>The <code>manimlib/animation/growing.py</code> file defines a set of animation classes that handle the visual effect of objects growing from specific points or edges within the Manim library. These animations are used to create dynamic visualizations where objects appear to expand or emerge from a designated location, enhancing the visual storytelling capabilities of Manim.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>GrowFromPoint</strong>: This class manages animations where a mobject grows outward from a specific point in space. It is initialized with the target object and the point of origin, optionally including a color for the point.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>GrowFromCenter</strong>: Handles animations where a mobject grows outward from its center, creating a symmetrical expansion effect.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>GrowFromEdge</strong>: Manages animations where a mobject grows outward from a specified edge, allowing for directional growth effects.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>GrowArrow</strong>: Specializes in animating arrows to grow from a point or edge, often used to emphasize directions or connections in diagrams.
  </li>
