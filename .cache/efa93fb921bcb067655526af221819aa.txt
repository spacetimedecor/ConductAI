<p>The <code>manimlib/mobject/value_tracker.py</code> file defines classes and methods for tracking and manipulating numerical values within the Manim animation framework. These classes encapsulate a value that can be animated and updated over time, enabling dynamic visualizations and animations that depend on changing numerical parameters.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ValueTracker</strong>: The primary class in this file, representing an invisible mobject that encodes a numerical value through its position. It allows for the value to be animated, updated, and manipulated just like any other mobject, facilitating complex animations that depend on changing parameters.</li>
  <li><strong>ExponentialValueTracker</strong>: (Likely present based on class name, though details are not provided in the excerpt) - Presumably a subclass of <code>ValueTracker</code> that manages values on an exponential scale, useful for animations requiring exponential growth or decay.</li>
  <li><strong>ComplexValueTracker</strong>: (Likely present based on class name, though details are not provided) - Presumably a subclass of <code>ValueTracker</code> that handles complex numbers, enabling animations involving complex-valued parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>ValueTracker</code> class provides methods to initialize the value, retrieve it, set a new value, and increment the current value. It uses uniforms for rendering, making the value accessible within shader programs or animations. This design allows for flexible, animated control of numerical parameters in visual scenes.</p>
