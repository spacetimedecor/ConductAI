The <code>manimlib/mobject/svg/brace.py</code> file defines classes and methods for creating and manipulating brace objects in SVG scenes within the Manim animation library. These classes facilitate the creation of braces, labels, and associated animations, enabling dynamic annotations and annotations with braces in mathematical visualizations.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>BraceLabel</strong>: Represents a brace with an attached label. It manages the creation, positioning, and updating of the brace and label, including animations for their appearance and modifications.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BraceText</strong>: A subclass of <code>BraceLabel</code> that uses <code>TexText</code> as the label constructor, allowing for LaTeX-rendered text labels on braces.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Brace.get_tex</strong>: A method that creates a LaTeX text object positioned at the tip of the brace, with optional spacing.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BraceLabel.creation_anim</strong>: Defines the animation sequence for the creation of a brace and its label, combining growth and fade-in effects.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BraceLabel.shift_brace</strong>: Updates the brace to surround a new object or list of objects, repositioning it accordingly.
  </li>
</ul>
