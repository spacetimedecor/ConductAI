<p>The <code>manimlib/shader_wrapper.py</code> file is responsible for defining classes and methods that manage shader programs used in rendering visual effects within the Manim library. It provides abstractions for initializing, managing, and rendering shader programs, facilitating the integration of custom shaders into the rendering pipeline.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ShaderWrapper</strong>: This class encapsulates the logic for initializing shader programs, managing shader-related data, and rendering associated graphics objects. Its methods include <code>init_program</code> for setting up shader programs and <code>render</code> for executing the rendering process.</li>
  <li><strong>VShaderWrapper</strong>: A subclass or specialized version of <code>ShaderWrapper</code> that adds specific rendering behavior, such as controlling the order of rendering stroke and fill components through its <code>render</code> method.</li>
</ul>
