<p>The <code>manimlib/animation/fading.py</code> file defines a set of classes responsible for creating fading animations within the Manim library. These animations involve changing the opacity of objects (mobjects) to make them appear or disappear smoothly, often with additional transformations such as shifting or scaling. The classes facilitate various types of fade effects, including fading in, fading out, and combined transformations.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fade</strong>: The base class for fading animations, allowing for shifting and scaling of the mobject during the fade process.</li>
  <li><strong>FadeIn</strong>: Inherits from <code>Fade</code>, implementing the animation that makes a mobject appear by increasing its opacity from transparent to opaque, with optional shifting and scaling.</li>
  <li><strong>FadeOut</strong>: Implements the animation that makes a mobject disappear by decreasing its opacity to transparent, with options for shifting and final alpha value.</li>
  <li><strong>FadeInFromPoint</strong>: (Not detailed in the provided snippet but implied by naming) Likely handles fading in a mobject starting from a specific point.</li>
  <li><strong>FadeOutToPoint</strong>: (Not detailed but implied) Handles fading out a mobject towards a specific point.</li>
  <li><strong>FadeTransform</strong>: (Not detailed but implied) Manages transforming one mobject into another with a fading effect.</li>
  <li><strong>FadeTransformPieces</strong>: (Not detailed but implied) Handles fading transformations involving pieces of mobjects.</li>
  <li><strong>VFadeIn</strong>: (Not detailed but implied) A vertical fade-in animation.</li>
  <li><strong>VFadeOut</strong>: (Not detailed but implied) A vertical fade-out animation.</li>
  <li><strong>VFadeInThenOut</strong>: (Not detailed but implied) Combines fade-in and fade-out effects vertically.</li>
</ul>
