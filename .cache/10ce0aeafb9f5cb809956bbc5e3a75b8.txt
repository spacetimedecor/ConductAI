<p>The <code>manimlib/mobject/mobject.py</code> file serves as a core component in the Manim library, defining the fundamental classes and functions for creating, managing, and manipulating mobjects (mathematical objects) used in visualizations. It provides the base classes for all visual objects, as well as specialized subclasses for grouping, point representation, and updating behaviors, enabling complex animations and interactions within scenes.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mobject</strong>: The base class for all mobjects, providing core functionalities such as transformations, appearance, and rendering.</li>
  <li><strong>Group</strong>: A subclass of Mobject that allows grouping multiple mobjects together for collective operations.</li>
  <li><strong>Point</strong>: Represents a point in space, typically used as a building block for more complex mobjects.</li>
  <li><strong>_AnimationBuilder</strong>: An internal class responsible for constructing animations applied to mobjects.</li>
  <li><strong>_UpdaterBuilder</strong>: Manages the creation and application of update functions that modify mobjects over time.</li>
  <li><strong>_FunctionalUpdaterBuilder</strong>: Extends updater functionality to support functional updates, enabling dynamic and flexible modifications.</li>
  <li><strong>override_animate</strong>: A function that overrides or customizes the default animation behavior for mobjects, allowing for tailored animation effects.</li>
</ul>
