    This code demonstrates how to debug object positioning and animation timing in Manim.
    It creates two squares, animates one moving across the screen, and then flashes around
    the second square. The <code>wait</code> calls are strategically placed to observe
    the state of the mobjects at different points in time, which is crucial for debugging
    timing and positioning issues.

from manim import *

class DebuggingPositioningAndTiming(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        # Create two squares
        square1 = Square(color=BLUE).shift(LEFT * 3)
        square2 = Square(color=RED).shift(RIGHT * 3)

        # Add squares to the scene
        self.add(square1, square2)

        # Debugging step 1: Observe initial positions
        # Use wait to pause the animation and visually inspect the scene.
        # If objects are not where expected, check their initial shift/move operations.
        self.wait(1) 

        # Animate square1 moving to the right
        # If the animation timing or final position is off,
        # adjust the run_time or the target position.
        self.play(square1.animate.shift(RIGHT * 6), run_time=2)

        # Debugging step 2: Observe positions after the first animation
        # This helps confirm if square1 reached its intended destination
        # and if square2 remained stationary as expected.
        self.wait(1)

        # Flash around square2
        # If FlashAround doesn't appear correctly or around the wrong object,
        # verify the target mobject and its current position.
        self.play(FlashAround(square2))

        # Debugging step 3: Final observation
        # A final wait allows for a complete visual check of the scene's state.
        self.wait(1)
