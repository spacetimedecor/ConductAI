<p>The <code>manimlib/animation/transform.py</code> file is responsible for defining various animation classes that handle the transformation and manipulation of objects within the Manim animation library. These classes facilitate smooth transitions, replacements, copying, and other transformation effects that are essential for creating dynamic visualizations and animations.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Transform</strong>: The base class for creating animations that morph one object into another, handling the interpolation between the initial and target states.</li>
  <li><strong>ReplacementTransform</strong>: A specialized transformation that replaces one object with another by transforming the former into the latter.</li>
  <li><strong>TransformFromCopy</strong>: Creates a transformation by copying an object and transforming the copy into a target object.</li>
  <li><strong>MoveToTarget</strong>: Animates an object moving to a predefined target position or state.</li>
  <li><strong>_MethodAnimation</strong>: An internal class used as a base for animations that apply specific methods to objects.</li>
  <li><strong>ApplyMethod</strong>: Applies a specified method to an object during an animation, enabling dynamic modifications.</li>
  <li><strong>ApplyPointwiseFunction</strong>: Applies a function to each point of an object, allowing for complex pointwise transformations.</li>
  <li><strong>ApplyPointwiseFunctionToCenter</strong>: Similar to <code>ApplyPointwiseFunction</code>, but specifically targets the center of objects.</li>
  <li><strong>FadeToColor</strong>: Animates an object fading to a specified color.</li>
  <li><strong>ScaleInPlace</strong>: Scales an object in place, enlarging or shrinking it without changing its position.</li>
  <li><strong>ShrinkToCenter</strong>: Animates an object shrinking towards its center point.</li>
  <li><strong>Restore</strong>: Restores an object to its original state after transformations.</li>
  <li><strong>ApplyFunction</strong>: Applies a general function to an object during an animation, enabling custom transformations.</li>
  <li><strong>ApplyMatrix</strong>: Applies a matrix transformation to an object, allowing for complex geometric transformations.</li>
  <li><strong>ApplyComplexFunction</strong>: Transforms objects using complex functions, useful for advanced mathematical visualizations.</li>
  <li><strong>CyclicReplace</strong>: Cyclically replaces multiple objects in a sequence, useful for animations involving rotations or cycles.</li>
  <li><strong>Swap</strong>: Swaps the positions or states of objects during an animation.</li>
</ul>
