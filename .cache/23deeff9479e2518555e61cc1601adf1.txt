<p>The <code>manimlib/event_handler/event_listner.py</code> file defines the <code>EventListener</code> class, which encapsulates the concept of an event listener within the system. Its primary purpose is to represent and manage individual event handlers that respond to specific user input events associated with objects (mobjects). This class facilitates the registration, comparison, and management of event listeners, enabling the system to handle user interactions effectively.</p>
