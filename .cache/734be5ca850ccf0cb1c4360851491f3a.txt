<p>The <code>special_tex.py</code> file in the <code>manimlib/mobject/svg</code> directory is responsible for defining classes that handle special types of LaTeX or SVG-based text objects used in animations. These classes facilitate the creation, customization, and manipulation of SVG elements representing mathematical or textual content, often with specific formatting or preset styles.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>BulletedList</strong>: This class likely provides a way to create and manage lists of bullet points within SVG objects, enabling structured presentation of information.</li>
  <li><strong>TexTextFromPresetString</strong>: This class probably allows the creation of LaTeX-based text objects from predefined string presets, simplifying the process of generating styled or formatted text snippets.</li>
  <li><strong>Title</strong>: This class is intended for creating title text objects, possibly with specific styling or positioning suitable for headings in animations.</li>
</ul>
