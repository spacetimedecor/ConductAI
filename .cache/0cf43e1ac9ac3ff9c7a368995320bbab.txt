<p>The 'manimlib/mobject/types' submodule is responsible for defining various classes that represent different types of mobjects, such as images, SVGs, surfaces, and vectorized objects, which are used as visual elements in animations. It provides the foundational structures for creating, manipulating, and rendering these diverse object types within the Manim library, enabling rich and varied visual representations in animated scenes.</p>
