<p>This code demonstrates how to integrate an external image into a Manim animation by creating an <code>ImageMobject</code> from a local file and displaying it in a scene.</p>
<pre><code>import os
from manimlib.mobject.mobject import Mobject
from manimlib.mobject.image_mobject import ImageMobject
from manimlib.scene.scene import Scene

        dummy_image_path = "dummy_image.png"
        try:
            from PIL import Image
            img = Image.new('RGB', (60, 30), color = 'red')

            # For the example to run, a placeholder ImageMobject will be created.
            # In a real application, you'd handle this more robustly.
            if not os.path.exists(dummy_image_path):
                print(f"Error: '{dummy_image_path}' not found. Please create it or install Pillow.")
